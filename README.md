# Android App to Control an LED Strip
This is a Java based Android App made to control a LED Superknight strip connected to a Raspberry Pi 3b+. It currently sends ssh commands asynchronous to the corresponding GPIO pin colors. This project will likely be moved to a React Native project to utilize Node.js with Raspberry Pi for better communication.
